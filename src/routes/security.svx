<p>We employ the following security controls at layer from physical to application level to ensure our customers can focus on their apps without worrying about infrastructure.

<h5>Security Assessments and Compliance</h5>

<h6>Data Centers</h6>

<p>Skygear’s physical infrastructure is hosted and managed within Amazon’s secure data centers and utilize the Amazon Web Service (AWS) technology. Amazon continually manages risk and undergoes recurring assessments to ensure compliance with industry standards. Amazon’s data center operations have been accredited under:

<ul><li class='' value='1'>ISO 27001

</li><li class=''>SOC 1/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (Previously SAS 70 Type II)

</li><li class=''>PCI Level 1

</li><li class=''>FISMA Moderate

</li><li class=''>Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)

</li><li class=''>PCI

</li></ul>

<p>We use payment processor Stripe for encrypting and processing credit card payments. Stripe is PCI Level 1 compliant.

<h6>Physical Security</h6>

<p>Skygear utilizes ISO 27001 and FISMA certified data centers managed by Amazon. Amazon has many years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the AWS platform and infrastructure. AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities, and critical facilities have extensive setback and military grade perimeter control berms as well as other natural boundary protection. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, state of the art intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication no fewer than three times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.

<p>Amazon only provides data center access and information to employees who have a legitimate business need for such privileges. When an employee no longer has a business need for these privileges, his or her access is immediately revoked, even if they continue to be an employee of Amazon or Amazon Web Services. All physical and electronic access to data centers by Amazon employees is logged and audited routinely.

<h5>Environmental Safeguards</h5>

<h6>Fire Detection and Suppression</h6>

<p>Automatic fire detection and suppression equipment has been installed to reduce risk. The fire detection system utilizes smoke detection sensors in all data center environments, mechanical and electrical infrastructure spaces, chiller rooms and generator equipment rooms. These areas are protected by either wet-pipe, double-interlocked pre-action, or gaseous sprinkler systems.

<h6>Power</h6>
<p>The data center electrical power systems are designed to be fully redundant and maintainable without impact to operations, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units provide back-up power in the event of an electrical failure for critical and essential loads in the facility. Data centers use generators to provide backup power for the entire facility.

<h6>Climate and Temperature Control</h6>

<p>Climate control is required to maintain a constant operating temperature for servers and other hardware, which prevents overheating and reduces the possibility of service outages. Data centers are conditioned to maintain atmospheric conditions at optimal levels. Monitoring systems and data center personnel ensure temperature and humidity are at the appropriate levels.

<h6>Management</h6>
<p>Data center staff monitor electrical, mechanical and life support systems and equipment so issues are immediately identified. Preventative maintenance is performed to maintain the continued operability of equipment.

<h5>Network Security</h5>

<h6>Firewalls</h6>
<p>Firewalls are utilized to restrict access to systems from external networks and between systems internally. By default all access is denied and only explicitly allowed ports and protocols are allowed based on business need. Each system is assigned to a firewall security group based on the system’s function. Security groups restrict access to only the ports and protocols required for a system’s specific function to mitigate risk.

<h6>Spoofing and Sniffing Protections</h6>
<p>Managed firewalls prevent IP, MAC, and ARP spoofing on the network and between virtual hosts to ensure spoofing is not possible. Packet sniffing is prevented by infrastructure including the hypervisor which will not deliver traffic to an interface which it is not addressed to. Skygear utilizes application isolation, operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections to further ensure risk is mitigated at all levels.

<h6>Port Scanning</h6>
<p>Port scanning is prohibited and every reported instance is investigated by our infrastructure provider. When port scans are detected, they are stopped and access is blocked.

<h5>Data Security</h5>
<p>Customer data is stored in separate access-controlled databases per application. Customers with multiple applications are assigned separate databases per application to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access between applications.

<h5>System Security</h5>

<h6>System Configuration</h6>

<p>System configuration and consistency is maintained through standard, up-to-date images, configuration management software, and by replacing systems with updated deployments. Systems are deployed using up-to-date images that are updated with configuration changes and security updates before deployment. Once deployed, existing systems are decommissioned and replaced with up-to-date systems.

<h6>System Authentication</h6>

<p>Operating system access is limited to Skygear staff and requires username and key authentication. Operating systems do not allow password authentication to prevent password brute force attacks, theft, and sharing.

<h5>Disaster Recovery</h5>

<h6>Skygear.io</h6>

<p>Skygear.io is designed for stability, scaling, and inherently mitigates common issues that lead to outages while maintaining recovery capabilities. Our platform maintains redundancy to prevent single points of failure, and is able to replace failed components..

<h5>Access to Customer Data</h5>

<p>Skygear staff does not access or interact with customer data or applications as part of normal operations. There may be cases where Skygear is requested to interact with customer data or applications at the request of the customer for support purposes or where required by law. Skygear may also inspect customer data to debug and troubleshoot platform issues.
